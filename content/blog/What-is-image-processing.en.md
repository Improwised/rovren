## What is Image Processing? 🤔

At its core, image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to alter or enhance its quality, extract useful information, or interpret the content within. These operations can range from simple tasks like resizing and cropping to complex processes involving pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms.

## Basic Operations in Image Processing 🤓

**Image processing involves a myriad of basic operations:**

**Image Enhancement ✨ :**
Techniques like contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and sharpening enhance the visual quality of an image. 

**Image Restoration 🪞 :** 
Algorithms are used to remove noise, blur, or other distortions from images, making them clearer and more usable.

**Image Segmentation 🧩 :** 
Dividing an image into multiple segments to simplify the representation of an image into meaningful information. 

**Feature Extraction 🔍 :** 
Identifying and extracting specific features from an image, often used in pattern recognition and computer vision tasks. 

**Image Compression 🗜️ :** 
Reducing the size of an image for efficient storage and transmission without significant loss of quality.
