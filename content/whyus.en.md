We understand that starting with OpenCV can be quite daunting. The
confusion surrounding input parameters and the lack of helpful
documentation can make the learning process frustrating. <br /><br />
Are you tired of constantly debugging your computer vision algorithms
because the OpenCV documentation fails to provide clarity on image
types?<br /><br />
Perhaps you're unsure which technique to employ for image restoration,
or you find yourself questioning whether image enhancement would be more
suitable.<br /><br />
    
      
- The frustration of selecting the right filter for image deblurring
  and sharpening is real. Understanding the distinction between
  filter2D kernel and other convolution kernels might catch you off
  guard.
      
- We recognize the difficulty in finding the optimal threshold value
  and truly comprehending the differences between local and global
  thresholding methods in OpenCV.
     
- You might still be grappling with the disparities between histogram
  equalization and normalization.
     
- Choosing the best image segmentation technique can be an uphill
  battle. Even deciding between dilation and erosion becomes
  challenging when you're uncertain which morphological transformation
  is required.
      
- The same applies to choosing between affine transformation and
  perspective image transformation.
     
- You may not be aware that the boundingRect operator can outperform
  minAreaRect in certain situations.
      
- Drawing an ellipse inside a rectangle or understanding the
  distinction between cv2.clone() and copyTo() might leave you
  scratching your head.
      
- And let's not even get started on the confusion between edges and
  contours in OpenCV, not to mention the differentiation between blobs
  and noise.
     
- If you haven't explored CLAHE, your color balancing tasks might not
  yield the desired quality results.

- And the concept of floodFilling might seem perplexing.
     
- Don't even get us started on moments operators and huMoments that
  can leave you puzzled.
     
- The houghLines function might sound like a foreign concept.
