            We understand that getting started with OpenCV can be challenging. After all the
            input parameters for functions are confusing and OpenCV documentation is not
            really helpful.

            <br/><br/>

            You might get tired of constantly debugging your computer vision algorithm just
            because OpenCV documentation didn’t tell you what image type to use.

            <br/><br/>

            You might not even know which technique to use for image restoration, or even
            doubt if you need to use image enhancement instead.
              
            <br/><br/>

            Deciding which filter to use for image deblurring and sharpening can be
            frustrating.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Or realizing the difference between filter2D kernel and other convolution kernels
            might surprise you.
            
            <br/><br/>

            We know it is difficult to find the optimal threshold value or truly understand the
            local thresholding method as opposed to the global thresholding method in
            OpenCV.

            <br/><br/>

            Or you might not quite understand the difference between histogram
            equalization and normalization.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Finding the best image segmentation technique is hard without a doubt.
            Even choosing between dilation or erosion can be challenging when you are not
            sure which morphological transformation you need.
            
            <br/><br/>

            The same is true for choosing between affine transformation and perspective
            image transformation.
            
            <br/><br/>

            You might not even be aware that the boundingRect operator might be better
            than minAreaRect in some situations.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Or you might not know how to draw an ellipse inside a rectangle.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Or what is the difference between cv2.clone() vs copyTo().
            
            <br/><br/>

            We don’t even want to mention not knowing the difference between an edge and
            a contour to detect them. Let alone knowing blob vs noise in OpenCV.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Your color balancing task might not get quality results if you haven’t heard about
            CLAHE.

            <br/><br/>

            And floodFilling probably seems confusing to you.
            
            <br/><br/>

            Not to mention moments operator and huMoments that make you scratch your
            head.

            <br/><br/>

            And the houghLines function that sounds like an alien word.

            <br/><br/>

            We also know you might find it challenging to use machine learning with OpenCV.
            
            <br/><br/>

            We know all that and many more. You are not alone. All image processing
            beginners, students, and hobbyists have many OpenCV confusions. That is why
            we are offering our OpenCV tutorials to help you.
