        We understand that starting with OpenCV can be quite daunting. The confusion surrounding input parameters and the lack of helpful documentation can make the learning process frustrating. <br /><br />
        Are you tired of constantly debugging your computer vision algorithms because the OpenCV documentation fails to provide clarity on image types?<br /><br />
        Perhaps you're unsure which technique to employ for image restoration, or you find yourself questioning whether image enhancement would be more suitable.<br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The frustration of selecting the right filter for image deblurring and sharpening is real. Understanding the distinction between filter2D kernel and other convolution kernels might catch you off guard.
          </li>
          <li>We recognize the difficulty in finding the optimal threshold value and truly comprehending the differences between local and global thresholding methods in OpenCV.</li>
          <li>You might still be grappling with the disparities between histogram equalization and normalization.</li>
          <li>
            Choosing the best image segmentation technique can be an uphill battle. Even deciding between dilation and erosion becomes challenging when you're uncertain which morphological transformation is required.
          </li>
          <li>The same applies to choosing between affine transformation and perspective image transformation.</li>
          <li>You may not be aware that the boundingRect operator can outperform minAreaRect in certain situations.</li>
          <li>Drawing an ellipse inside a rectangle or understanding the distinction between cv2.clone() and copyTo() might leave you scratching your head.</li>
          <li>And let's not even get started on the confusion between edges and contours in OpenCV, not to mention the differentiation between blobs and noise.</li>
          <li>If you haven't explored CLAHE, your color balancing tasks might not yield the desired quality results.</li>
          <li>And the concept of floodFilling might seem perplexing.</li>
          <li>Don't even get us started on moments operators and huMoments that can leave you puzzled.</li>
          <li>The houghLines function might sound like a foreign concept.</li>
        </ul>
        We understand the challenges of using machine learning with OpenCV.<br /><br />
        We are well aware of all these challenges and more. You are not alone. Many beginners, students, and hobbyists in image processing face similar confusions when it comes to OpenCV. That's precisely why we offer our comprehensive OpenCV tutorials to assist you.<br /><br />
