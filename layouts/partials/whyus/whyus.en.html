    We understand that starting with OpenCV can be quite daunting. The
    confusion surrounding input parameters and the lack of helpful
    documentation can make the learning process frustrating. <br /><br />
    Are you tired of constantly debugging your computer vision algorithms
    because the OpenCV documentation fails to provide clarity on image
    types?<br /><br />
    Perhaps you're unsure which technique to employ for image restoration,
    or you find yourself questioning whether image enhancement would be more
    suitable.<br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        The frustration of selecting the right filter for image deblurring
        and sharpening is real. Understanding the distinction between
        filter2D kernel and other convolution kernels might catch you off
        guard.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recognize the difficulty in finding the optimal threshold value
        and truly comprehending the differences between local and global
        thresholding methods in OpenCV.
      </li>
      <li>
        You might still be grappling with the disparities between histogram
        equalization and normalization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choosing the best image segmentation technique can be an uphill
        battle. Even deciding between dilation and erosion becomes
        challenging when you're uncertain which morphological transformation
        is required.
      </li>
      <li>
        The same applies to choosing between affine transformation and
        perspective image transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not be aware that the boundingRect operator can outperform
        minAreaRect in certain situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drawing an ellipse inside a rectangle or understanding the
        distinction between cv2.clone() and copyTo() might leave you
        scratching your head.
      </li>
      <li>
        And let's not even get started on the confusion between edges and
        contours in OpenCV, not to mention the differentiation between blobs
        and noise.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you haven't explored CLAHE, your color balancing tasks might not
        yield the desired quality results.
      </li>
      <li>And the concept of floodFilling might seem perplexing.</li>
      <li>
        Don't even get us started on moments operators and huMoments that
        can leave you puzzled.
      </li>
      <li>The houghLines function might sound like a foreign concept.</li>
    </ul>
